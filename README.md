In Uganda, radio programs are a critical mode for sharing information and reaching out to rural communities. Farmers throughout Uganda, and across Africa, rely on radio programs in their local languages to learn more about agricultural practices and to obtain important market information.

While they are extremely valuable to their target listeners (agriculturalists), the content of these programs can also be important for researchers, government, and other decision makers as they provide an important source of information on the state of the agricultural sector. However the value to these other actors can be limited by the fact that this type of data is not easily monitored or analyzed, as the data is unstructured, often in local languages, and of varying sound quality.

The objective of this competition is to build a machine learning model to identify the agricultural keyword (which may be in English or Luganda) spoken in an audio clip. The keywords relate to crops, diseases, fertilizers, herbicides or other general agricultural topics.

This solution will help researchers from Makerere University who are developing a speech recognition model to automate the process of monitoring Luganda radio programs for agriculture-related information. This solution will enable more efficient monitoring and analysis of local language radio programs, and your work can possibly open doors for this type of natural language processing tasks in other local languages across Africa and across other sectors that use radio as a means of communication.
